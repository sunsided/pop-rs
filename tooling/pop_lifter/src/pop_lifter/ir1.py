"""IR1: a C-like, opcode-for-opcode lifting of 6502 assembly.

Goals for this stage:

* Stay close to the underlying 6502. Pseudo-registers `a, x, y`; flag
  pseudo-globals `c, z, n, v`. Every IR1 instruction maps back to exactly
  one Merlin source line via `SourceRef`.
* Resolve operand symbols against the equate table from pass 0 so each
  memory access carries both its name (`clrU`) and the concrete address
  (`$d6`).
* Keep control flow explicit and unstructured. Conditional branches lower
  to `branch(cond, label)`; unconditional jumps to `goto(label)`.

Pass 2 will reconstruct structured control flow, fold flag updates, fuse
parallel arrays, and recognise 16-bit add/sub patterns. None of that
happens here.

The instruction set covered by the current lifter is the minimum the
AUTO.S combat-button pilot needs (immediate load, absolute store,
unconditional jump, rts). Other opcodes appear as `Unsupported` so the
lifted IR1 still round-trips line-for-line with the source.

    only have meaning inside the routine — so we keep the symbolic
    `(target_label, offset)` instead of resolving to an address.

    Two things wear this shape:

    * **Self-modifying code** (the common case, `offset >= 1`):
      `sta :smXCO+1` patches the operand byte of the instruction
      labelled `:smXCO`. POP's HIRES.S blitter is full of it —
      patching immediate values and absolute addresses at runtime
      for speed. The standard high-level-port transform converts
      the patched operand into a mutable variable; that's pass 3's
      job. Lifting the store as a structured node (instead of
      leaving it `???`) gives pass 3 a recognisable idiom to match.

    * **Plain stores to a local data label** (`offset == 0`):
      `sta :buffer`. Not SMC — just a store to a labelled scratch
      location. We can't tell the two apart at pass 1 without
      knowing what `:label` points at, so both lift to `StoreLocal`
      and pass 3 disambiguates from the label's definition.

    The interpreter records the write in `Trace.code_patches`
